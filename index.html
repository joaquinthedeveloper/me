            <p class="about-me"> My passion for web development came from joking around with friends about me going into the tech industry.
              After, continuing to joke and talk more about it, I finally decided to learn on my own. Which was much harder than I thought. 
              As I continued to attempt to learn how to code, I saw a friend who graduated from Thinkful, 
              I messaged her, talked to her about it, and it peaked my interests. 
              I decided to become a stusdent a Thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a Software Engineer and couldn't be more excited.
              I am so excited to get this new career started and work with others and learn from other developers.
